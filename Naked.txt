Lyrics to Ella Mai song Naked

Take away the big shirts, the tattoos, the sweatpants and Vans
Okay, I don't wear no makeup, no purse in my hands
My resting bitch face is mistaken for the mean girl
But what if I told you
There's nothing I want more in this world
Than somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Might be a bitch in the morning so catch me at night time
Some of my friends think I'm moody but I think I'm just fine
I could be pissed but I act like I'm not
I really remember when I say, "I forgot"
No matter how hard I try
To run away from love at the end of the night
I need somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
I need someone who loves me when I wake up
Who thinks I'm beautiful when I'm looking fucked up
I want the perfect love, am I asking too much
Someone who shoots for the stars
Knowing I think I'm never good enough
I need somebody who loves me naked (who loves me naked)
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it (knows how to take it)
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Naked
